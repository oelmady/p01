Compile/run:
     - Compile using
            make MetroSim
     - run executable with
            ./MetroSim stationsFile passFile [commands]


Program Purpose:
To create a program that simulates action on a real train, with passengers, stations, and a train that carries passengers from their starting station to their destination.

Files: 

main.cpp:
     STUDENT TO-DO: Main file should be short and handle simple driver
     functions such as reading in files.

MetroSim.cpp:
     STUDENT TO-DO: Implementation of MetroSim class.  Main
     functionality of running the Metro Simulation, should be able to
     move trains and deal with passengers going on/off the train.

MetroSim.h:
     STUDENT TO-DO: Interface of MetroSim class.

stations.txt:
     an example file containing a list of stations.

test_commands.txt:
     sample list of commands that you could give to the simulator

the_metroSim:
     reference implementation for students to see how 


Note:  the program should handle all cases.

Data Structures:


Testing:

Here describe the following: process of testing (unit tests), mention
of bugs you encountered while testing, mention of testing on inputs of
different sizes and edge cases, good description of base cases you
considered while testing. Demonstrate a methodical approach to
testing.  This section of your REAMDE should be very thorough for
assignments.

Note: This assignment comes partially implemented, but student must also
create the driver and add class functionality.

Part that you found most difficult:

Here, indicate the part of the assignment that you found the most
challenging. It could be a concept (ie. stacks) or something specific
to the assignment. This will help us know what to review and what to
focus on.
