compartments are vectors of pointers to passenger queues
stations are vectors of pointers to passenger queues

passenger queues are queues of pointers to passengers

passengers are instances of a class with some data 

metro contains compartments and stations 
when the sim moves, metro calls in order:
1. disembark
2. move, which calls
    3. board train
4. print train

metro sim operates on user interface to perform
1. create new passengers, and assigns them the id
2. moves the metro
3. ends the simulation

make the interface for std::cin and commands.txt first~
then make the back end depending on the input requirements of the front end
